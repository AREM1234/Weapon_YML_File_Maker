# Weapon_YML_File_Maker
A simple python script that takes a template file and replaces a bunch of template stuff with various things to create a large YML file.
Needed a script to create a bunch of YML files that contained weapons that would scale up in power, requirements, and other things as you got higher tier items. This takes a template and handles that.

The settings file handles broader range things that get changed on each run.
The actual code contains some dictionaries that are referenced to take care of the scaling part.

Not the most elegant code but just needed to throw together something to get the job done.
